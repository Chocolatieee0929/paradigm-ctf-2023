# Paradigm CTF 2023

These are the files for Paradigm CTF 2023. To run a challenge locally, you will first need to start a local copy
of the Paradigm CTF [infrastructure](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/paradigm-ctf-infrastructure). Then, you can
simply `docker compose up` in any CTF challenge of your choice.

Challenges are deployed to production using kCTF.
