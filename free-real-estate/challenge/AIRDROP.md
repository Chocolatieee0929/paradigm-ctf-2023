The INU airdrop follows rules similar to the original UNI airdrop:

1. Reward 10,000 INU to each eligible address that redeemed SOCKS or holds SOCKS
2. Reward 400 INU to each eligible address that has performed a swap on Uniswap 1, 2, or 3
3. Reward Uniswap LP's as follows:
    i. allocate 50M + 50M + 50M INU to LPs of Uniswap 1 / 2 / 3
    ii. distribute rewards across pools pro rata based on number of historical swaps per pool
    iii. within each pool, distribute rewards to eligible LPs pro rata based on the total amount minted by each LP

Only a subset of addresses are eligible:
- must not be an EOA
- must not be a Gnosis Safe

This results in a total allocation of 214M INU across 146K eligible addresses.
